- Use your desired plugin name in place of **_wp-demo-plugin_** in above command.
- Navigate to the cloned directory using `cd` command.
- In the plugin directory run `npm i` and `composer install`.
- Run `npm run setup` to start automated setup process.

  These are some examples of plugin names: **WP Mail Checker**, **Bulk Email Sender**, **WP Users Importer**
- After a valid input, In a few seconds, you'll see **Complete!** message if everything goes ok.

## Important keywords

| Keyword       | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Custom_Plugin | Used in the final class name & as other class name prefixes. |

## How setup works?

In this plugin boilerplate code above **Important keywords** are used in a way that helps the setup code to match and replace the keywords with your given plugin name.

`npm run setup` is a one-time command, After successful completion, the setup code and script will be removed from the `package.json` and some of the packages that are used in the setup will be removed as well and you'll only have packages that are used in plugin development ahead.

## Plugin structure

**custom-plugin.php**\
Main plugin file which contains all the plugin information and some defined CONST and a global functions that returns main class instance.

**gulpfile.js**\
It has all the tasks setup for **_js, css, image, and font_** files.

**languages**\

**includes**\
